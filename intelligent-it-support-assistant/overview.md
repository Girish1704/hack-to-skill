# Build an Intelligent IT Support Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building an Intelligent IT Support Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you’ll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can understand user issues, create IT service tickets, and even provide intelligent recommendations using Azure AI.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered IT Support Assistant that transforms how enterprises handle support requests. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and Azure AI Search, you’ll design a system that can automatically respond to common IT issues, generate and manage service tickets, and surface insights into recurring problems.

This assistant will act as a virtual IT helpdesk integrating automation, reasoning, and observability to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient support experiences for users and engineers alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create an AI-powered IT support chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Integrate Power Automate workflows for automated ticket creation and escalation.
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry models for intelligent ticket analysis and summarization.
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search for contextual query responses.
- Implement observability and telemetry with Azure Monitor and Dataverse to track usage and performance.
  
## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world enterprise AI implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Intelligent IT Support Assistant:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Build a basic Copilot agent that can answer IT FAQs using knowledge sources.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** - Integrate Power Automate workflows for automated ticket creation and escalation.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** - Connect Azure AI Foundry and AI Search to add contextual reasoning, recommendations, and telemetry dashboards.

Throughout each challenge, you’ll:
- Analyze the problem statement and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a conversational IT assistant capable of answering helpdesk queries. You’ll then integrate Power Automate to simulate real-time ticket creation and escalation. Finally, you’ll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Monitor to deliver intelligent reasoning and insights on support operations.

By the end of this hackathon, you’ll have a fully functional AI-driven IT Support Copilot capable of autonomous query handling, intelligent recommendations, and end-to-end support workflow automation.
