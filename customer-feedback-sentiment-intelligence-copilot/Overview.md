# Build a Customer Feedback & Sentiment Intelligence Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building a Customer Feedback & Sentiment Intelligence Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can collect feedback, analyze sentiment, detect trends, and trigger alerts to improve customer experience proactively.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered assistant that transforms how organizations understand and act on customer feedback. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Language Services, and Azure AI Search, you'll design a system that can ingest multi-channel feedback, summarize key themes, track sentiment across channels, and surface insights to the right teams at the right time.

This assistant will act as a virtual CX analyst integrating automation, reasoning, and observability to deliver faster detection of issues, smarter recommendations, and consistent insight-sharing across the organization.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create a customer feedback & sentiment chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Integrate Power Automate workflows for multi-channel feedback processing and automated alerts.
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Language for sentiment analysis and trend detection.
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search for contextual query responses.
- Implement observability and telemetry with Azure Monitor to track customer sentiment metrics and trends.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world CX analytics implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Customer Feedback & Sentiment Intelligence Copilot:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Build a basic Copilot agent that can collect structured customer feedback and answer common FAQs.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** - Use Power Automate to process feedback, apply Azure AI Language sentiment analysis, and trigger automated alerts based on sentiment thresholds.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** - Connect Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search to add cross-channel summarization, trend detection, and proactive recommendations with dashboards for CX metrics.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:

- Analyze the problem statement and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins by setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to collect feedback and answer FAQs. You'll then integrate Power Automate to process multi-channel feedback with sentiment analysis and route alerts to the right teams. Finally, you'll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Monitor to deliver executive summaries, trend insights, and telemetry-rich dashboards for continuous CX improvement.

By the end of this hackathon, you'll have a fully functional Customer Feedback & Sentiment Intelligence Copilot capable of conversational analytics, automated alerting, and end-to-end insight generation.
