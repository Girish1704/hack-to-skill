# Challenge 2: Integrate Power Automate Tools within Copilot Studio for HR Feedback and Compliance
  
## Problem Statement

Policy answers alone aren't enough—HR also needs structured feedback, clarification requests, and automated reminders for compliance or training renewals. In this challenge, you'll integrate **Power Automate** with your Copilot to capture employee inputs and trigger proactive workflows directly within the Copilot Studio portal using Freshdesk for tracking and Teams for notifications.

## Goals

- Automate HR feedback collection and compliance tracking through Copilot Studio's integrated Power Automate tools.
- Enable Microsoft Teams based notifications for HR staff.
- Store and manage all feedback data within Freshdesk in a structured format.

## Datasets  

- Use the pre-provided dataset in `C:\datasets\hr_feedback_template.csv`.
- This dataset contains sample feedback templates and metadata to guide the feedback structure.

## Challenge Objectives  

1. **Set Up Freshdesk Free Trial Account**
   - Navigate to [Freshdesk Free Trial](https://freshdesk.com/signup) and create a free trial account.
   - Complete the setup wizard and note down your **Freshdesk domain** (e.g., `yourcompany.freshdesk.com`).
   - Navigate to **Profile Settings → API Key** and copy your API key for later use.
   - Create a custom ticket category for **HR Feedback** in Freshdesk settings.

2. **Open Copilot Studio and Access Power Automate Tools**
   - Launch **Microsoft Copilot Studio** from your Microsoft 365 portal.
   - Open the **HRInsights-Foundation** agent you created in the previous challenge.
   - From the left navigation panel, go to **Tools → Power Automate** to view available connectors and builder options.

3. **Create a Power Automate Flow for Feedback Submission**
   - In Copilot Studio, navigate to **Tools → Power Automate → Create Flow**.
   - Name the flow **SubmitHRFeedback**.
   - Add the following steps:
     1. **Trigger:** Use **When a Copilot topic runs this flow**.
     2. **Action 1:** Add an **HTTP** action to create a Freshdesk ticket for feedback.
        - Method: **POST**
        - URI: `https://yourcompany.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets`
        - Headers:
          - `Content-Type`: `application/json`
          - `Authorization`: `Basic <base64_encoded_api_key>`
        - Body (JSON):
          ```json
          {
            "subject": "HR Feedback: @{triggerBody()?['policyTopic']}",
            "description": "@{triggerBody()?['feedbackText']}",
            "email": "@{triggerBody()?['employeeEmail']}",
            "priority": 2,
            "status": 2,
            "type": "Question",
            "tags": ["hr-feedback"]
          }
          ```
     3. **Action 2:** Parse the response JSON to extract the **Ticket ID**.
     4. **Action 3:** Add a **Teams → Post message in a channel** action.
        - Channel: **HR Feedback** (create if needed).
        - Message: Include Feedback Topic, Employee Email, and Ticket ID.
   - Save and test the flow to ensure it successfully creates Freshdesk tickets and sends Teams messages.

4. **Create a Power Automate Flow for Policy Clarification Requests**
   - In Copilot Studio, create a second flow named **RequestPolicyClarification**.
   - Add the following steps:
     1. **Trigger:** Use **When a Copilot topic runs this flow**.
     2. **Action 1:** Create a Freshdesk ticket with type "Problem" and tag "clarification-needed".
     3. **Action 2:** Send an email to the HR mailbox with the employee's question and policy reference.
     4. **Action 3:** Return ticket confirmation to Copilot.

5. **Create a Power Automate Flow for Compliance Reminders**
   - Create a third flow named **ComplianceReminders**.
   - Configure as a **Scheduled** flow (daily at 9 AM).
   - Add logic to:
     - Query a list of compliance tasks (can be maintained in a SharePoint list or use sample data).
     - Send **Teams** messages to employees with upcoming compliance deadlines (within 7 days).
     - Include "Acknowledge" adaptive card buttons for user confirmation.

6. **Integrate the Flows into Your Copilot Agent**
   - In **Copilot Studio → Topics**, create or open a topic named **Feedback-and-Compliance**.
   - Add **Trigger phrases** like:
     - `I want to give feedback on HR policies`
     - `Request clarification about benefits`
     - `Need help understanding leave policy`
   - Add question nodes to collect:
     - Employee email
     - Policy topic
     - Feedback or question text
   - Add a **Power Automate Action Node** to call the appropriate flow based on user intent.
   - Map conversation variables to flow parameters.
   - Display the returned Ticket ID to the user in a confirmation message.

6. **Testing the Agent**
   - Use the **Test your copilot** panel to simulate conversations such as:
     - `I want to give feedback on the remote work policy.`
     - `Raise a clarification on sick leave eligibility.`
   - Verify that the flow executes, a Freshdesk ticket is created, and a Teams notification is received.
   - Login to your Freshdesk portal and confirm the ticket appears with correct details.

7. **Publishing the Agent**
   - Navigate to **Settings → Channels**.
   - Enable **Demo Web App** channel.
   - Disable authentication for ease of access.
   - Publish and test the agent in the browser.

## Success Criteria  

- The Copilot agent successfully triggers feedback collection flows within the Copilot Studio portal.
- Tickets appear correctly in Freshdesk with assigned IDs and proper categorization.
- Teams notifications are sent automatically when feedback is submitted.
- Users receive confirmation messages with Ticket ID in the chat.
