# Build an HR Policy & Talent Insights Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building an HR Policy & Talent Insights Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can answer employee policy queries, automate HR workflows, and provide intelligent insights from engagement data.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered HR Policy Assistant that transforms how enterprises handle policy dissemination and talent insights. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and Azure AI Search, you'll design a system that can automatically respond to HR policy questions, collect feedback, and surface sentiment insights from employee engagement data.

This assistant will act as a virtual HR helpdesk integrating automation, reasoning, and observability to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient employee experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create an AI-powered HR policy chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Integrate Power Automate workflows for feedback collection and compliance reminders.
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry models for sentiment analysis and engagement insights.
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search for policy and survey data.
- Implement observability and telemetry with Azure Monitor to track HR metrics and employee engagement.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world enterprise AI implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the HR Policy & Talent Insights Assistant:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Build a basic Copilot agent that can answer HR policy FAQs using SharePoint as knowledge source.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** - Integrate Power Automate workflows for feedback collection and compliance reminders.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** - Connect Azure AI Foundry and AI Search to add sentiment analysis, trend detection, and HR metrics dashboards.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:

- Analyze the problem statement and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a conversational HR assistant capable of answering policy queries. You'll then integrate Power Automate to collect feedback and send compliance reminders. Finally, you'll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Monitor to deliver sentiment analysis and insights on employee engagement.

By the end of this hackathon, you'll have a fully functional AI-driven HR Policy Copilot capable of autonomous policy assistance, feedback automation, and intelligent talent insights.
