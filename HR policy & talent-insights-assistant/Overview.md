# Build an HR Policy & Talent Insights Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise HR automation by building an HR Policy & Talent Insights Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you’ll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can answer HR policy questions, collect feedback, and generate talent insights using Azure AI.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered HR assistant that streamlines how employees discover policies and how HR analyzes engagement. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and Azure AI Search, you’ll design a system that can automatically respond to policy and benefits questions, trigger HR workflows, and surface insights into sentiment and recurring themes.

This assistant will act as a virtual HR partner integrating knowledge retrieval from SharePoint, Power Automate workflows, and intelligent reasoning with observability and governance to deliver faster, clearer, and more consistent HR experiences.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create a policy-aware HR chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio with SharePoint as the knowledge source.
- Integrate Power Automate workflows for feedback submission, policy clarifications, and automated compliance/training reminders.
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry models for summarization and sentiment analysis over HR feedback data.
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search for contextual, grounded responses.
- Implement observability and telemetry with Azure Monitor and Dataverse to track usage, themes, and performance.
  
## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world enterprise HR AI implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the HR Policy & Talent Insights Assistant:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Build a basic Copilot agent that can answer HR policies, leave rules, and benefits FAQs using SharePoint as a knowledge base.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** - Integrate Power Automate workflows for feedback submission, policy clarification requests, and automated compliance/training reminders.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** - Connect Azure AI Foundry and AI Search to add summarization, sentiment, and trend insights, and publish telemetry dashboards with Azure Monitor.

- Throughout each challenge, you’ll:
    - Analyze the problem statement and business scenario.
    - Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.
    - Leverage your Azure/Microsoft 365 environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a conversational HR assistant grounded in SharePoint policy content. You’ll then integrate Power Automate to enable structured feedback, clarification routing, and compliance reminders backed by Dataverse and Teams. Finally, you’ll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Monitor to deliver intelligent summaries, sentiment analysis, trends, and proactive recommendations for HR operations.

By the end of this hackathon, you’ll have a fully functional HR Policy & Talent Insights Copilot capable of autonomous policy Q&A, automated HR workflows, and AI-driven insights for decision-making.
