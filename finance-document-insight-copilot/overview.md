# Build a Finance Document Insight Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building a **Finance Document Insight Copilot** using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you’ll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can extract key fields from finance documents, validate compliance, reconcile data, and even provide insight summaries using Azure AI.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered Finance Copilot that streamlines document processing and insight generation. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Document Intelligence, and Azure AI Search, you’ll design a system that can automatically parse invoices and statements, surface vendor/payment insights, and route approvals—reducing cycle times and improving accuracy for finance teams.

This assistant will act as a virtual finance analyst integrating knowledge retrieval (SharePoint repositories), workflow automation (Power Automate + Dataverse/Excel), and advanced reasoning (Foundry models) with observability and governed access.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create a finance-aware chatbot using **Microsoft Copilot Studio** with **SharePoint** as the knowledge base.  
- Integrate **Azure Document Intelligence** to extract invoice fields (totals, tax, supplier, dates) via an **Azure Function façade**.  
- Deploy and connect **Azure AI Foundry** models for **summarization**, **reasoning**, and **anomaly hints** across documents.  
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences with **Azure AI Search** for grounded finance insights.  
- Automate **approvals** and **routing** with **Power Automate**; store structured outputs in **Dataverse** or **Excel** and light up **Power BI** dashboards for spend analysis.  
- Apply governance, security, and observability practices for finance data.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world finance automation rollout:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** — Build a Copilot Studio chatbot capable of answering finance FAQs and handling manual document uploads; connect to SharePoint-based invoice repositories.  
- **Challenge 2: Integration** — Add Power Automate flows and **Azure Document Intelligence** to automatically extract key fields and store them in **Dataverse/Excel**; generate approval cards for expense validation.  
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** — Connect **Azure AI Foundry** and **Azure AI Search** to deliver document summarization, anomaly detection, and spend trend insights; integrate **Power BI** dashboards and approvals for a closed-loop process.

Throughout each challenge, you’ll:  
- Analyze the problem statement and finance business scenario.  
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.  
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins by grounding the Copilot in trusted finance FAQs and SharePoint repositories so teams can query and upload documents in one place. Next, you’ll wire in Document Intelligence and Power Automate to extract fields, validate entries, and route approvals with structured storage in Dataverse or Excel. Finally, you’ll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry and AI Search to summarize documents, highlight anomalies, and reveal spend trends, while dashboards in Power BI provide ongoing visibility and control.

By the end of this hackathon, you’ll have a functional **Finance Document Insight Copilot** capable of conversational document intake, automated extraction and approvals, and AI-driven insights for finance decision-making.
