# Build a Finance Document Insight Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building a Finance Document Insight Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can extract key fields from finance documents, validate compliance, reconcile data, and provide insight summaries using Azure AI.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered Finance Copilot that transforms how organizations handle invoice processing and financial document analysis. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Azure Document Intelligence, and Azure AI Search, you'll design a system that can automatically parse invoices and statements, extract key financial data, detect anomalies, and route approvals—reducing cycle times and improving accuracy for finance teams.

This assistant will act as a virtual finance analyst integrating automation, reasoning, and observability to deliver faster document processing, smarter financial insights, and consistent compliance validation across the organization.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create a finance document processing chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Integrate Power Automate workflows for automated document processing and approval workflows.
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry and Azure Document Intelligence for field extraction and document analysis.
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search for contextual financial query responses.
- Implement observability and telemetry with Azure Monitor to track document processing metrics and financial analytics.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world finance automation implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Finance Document Insight Copilot:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Build a basic Copilot agent that can answer finance FAQs and guide document upload processes using knowledge sources.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** - Integrate Power Automate and Azure Document Intelligence to automatically extract invoice fields, store them in Dataverse, and trigger approval workflows.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** - Connect Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search to add document summarization, anomaly detection, and financial trend analysis with dashboards for finance metrics.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:

- Analyze the problem statement and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a conversational finance assistant capable of answering policy queries and guiding document uploads. You'll then integrate Power Automate and Azure Document Intelligence to automate field extraction and approval workflows. Finally, you'll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Monitor to deliver intelligent document analysis, anomaly detection, and executive summaries for strategic financial decision-making.

By the end of this hackathon, you'll have a fully functional AI-driven Finance Document Insight Copilot capable of autonomous document processing, intelligent financial analysis, and end-to-end workflow automation.
