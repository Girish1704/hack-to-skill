# Challenge 3: Add Cross-Domain Intelligence with Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search

## Problem Statement

While basic FAQ responses and system integrations provide value, enterprises need intelligent insights that can reason across departments, identify patterns, and provide proactive recommendations. Manual analysis of cross-domain data limits strategic decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Challenge Objectives

Transform your Unified Enterprise Copilot into an intelligent system that provides cross-domain insights, automated reasoning, and predictive recommendations using Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search.

### Step 1: Azure AI Foundry Environment Setup

- Access Azure AI Foundry and create a new project for enterprise intelligence
- Deploy AI models for natural language understanding and reasoning
- Configure model endpoints and API connections for your Copilot integration
- Set up proper authentication and security for AI service access
- Establish monitoring and usage tracking for AI model consumption

### Step 2: Azure AI Search Configuration

- Create an Azure AI Search service for enterprise knowledge indexing
- Index content from your HR, Finance, and IT knowledge sources
- Configure semantic search capabilities for intelligent content retrieval
- Set up vector search for similarity-based content discovery
- Implement search filters and facets for department-specific queries

### Step 3: Intelligent Query Processing

- Design query processing logic that can understand cross-domain requests
- Implement AI-powered intent recognition for complex business scenarios
