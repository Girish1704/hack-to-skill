# Challenge 2: Integrate Enterprise Systems with Power Automate and Dataverse

## Problem Statement

Enterprise data silos across HR, Finance, and IT departments prevent unified access and automated workflows. Without proper integration, employees face inefficient manual processes and lack real-time data access across departmental boundaries.

## Challenge Objectives

Extend your Unified Enterprise Copilot to integrate with live systems using Power Automate and Dataverse, enabling real-time data access and automated actions across departments.

### Step 1: Dataverse Environment Setup

- Access your Power Platform environment and navigate to Dataverse
- Create new tables for enterprise data integration:
  - **Employee Records**: HR data including status, department, and contact information
  - **Financial Transactions**: Invoice and expense data with approval workflows
  - **Support Tickets**: IT service requests with priority and resolution tracking
- Configure appropriate security roles and column permissions for each table

### Step 2: Power Automate Flow Creation

- Create automated flows for data synchronization and action triggers
- Design flows for cross-departmental data retrieval and updates
- Implement approval workflows that span multiple departments
- Configure error handling and notification systems for failed operations
- Set up scheduled flows for regular data synchronization processes

### Step 3: Copilot Integration with Live Data

- Navigate to your Copilot in Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Connect Power Automate flows as actions within your Copilot topics
- Configure dynamic data retrieval based on user queries and permissions
- Implement user authentication and role-based access controls
- Create topics that can trigger workflows and return real-time status updates

### Step 4: Create Unified Query Capabilities

- Design topics that can query across multiple departments simultaneously
- Implement cross-reference capabilities for related data across systems
- Configure conditional logic for department-specific query handling
- Set up data aggregation and summary generation for executive reporting
- Create escalation workflows for complex cross-departmental requests

### Step 5: Test Cross-Department Workflows

- Validate data retrieval across all integrated systems
- Test automated approval workflows spanning multiple departments
- Verify user permissions and access controls work correctly
- Confirm error handling and fallback scenarios function properly
- Test end-to-end scenarios from Copilot query to system action completion

### Step 6: Deploy Enhanced Integration

- Publish the updated Copilot with full system integration
- Configure monitoring and logging for all automated workflows
- Set up performance dashboards for system health and usage metrics
- Implement backup and recovery procedures for critical data flows
- Conduct user acceptance testing with stakeholders from each department

## Success Criteria

✅ Dataverse tables configured with appropriate data and security settings  
✅ Power Automate flows created for cross-departmental data access and workflows  
✅ Copilot successfully integrated with live systems and real-time data  
✅ Cross-department queries working with proper authentication and permissions  
✅ Automated workflows tested and functioning across HR, Finance, and IT systems  

## Next Steps

After completing this integration, proceed to **Challenge 3** where you'll add advanced AI capabilities with Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search for intelligent cross-domain insights and recommendations.
