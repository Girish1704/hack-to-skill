# Build a Unified Enterprise Copilot using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building a **Unified Enterprise Copilot** using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can understand multi-domain requests, retrieve insights across HR/Finance/IT, trigger workflows, and provide intelligent recommendations using Azure AI.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered Enterprise Copilot that breaks down organizational silos. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, and Azure AI Search, you'll design a system that can answer cross-domain queries, initiate approvals, and orchestrate actions with unified governance and observability.

This assistant will act as an enterprise-wide interface that integrates knowledge, automation, and reasoning—delivering faster, smarter, and more consistent insights for business and technology teams alike.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create a multi-domain enterprise chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Integrate Power Automate and Dataverse to unify data access and secure actions across departments
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry models for orchestration, summarization, and cross-domain reasoning
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search to ground answers in curated HR/Finance/IT sources
- Implement observability and governance with Azure Monitor and API Management for enterprise-grade control

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based Learning

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world enterprise AI implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Unified Enterprise Copilot:

### Challenge 1: Foundation
Build a basic Copilot agent that can answer simple cross-domain FAQs (IT, HR, Finance) using SharePoint or Excel knowledge sources.

### Challenge 2: Integration  
Connect systems using Power Automate and Dataverse to unify data access; enable user authentication and secure queries across departments.

### Challenge 3: Intelligence
Connect Azure AI Foundry and AI Search to add cross-domain reasoning, actionable recommendations, and workflow orchestration with telemetry dashboards.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:
- Analyze the problem statement and business scenario
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to answer foundational FAQs across HR, Finance, and IT using structured knowledge sources. You'll then integrate Power Automate and Dataverse to unify data access, secure actions, and enable authenticated, department-aware queries. Finally, you'll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search to deliver cross-domain reasoning, orchestrate workflows, and surface insights via Teams and dashboards—with Azure Monitor providing observability and governance.

By the end of this hackathon, you'll have a fully functional **Unified Enterprise Copilot** capable of natural-language data access, secure automation, and intelligent cross-domain insight delivery.
