# Build a Predictive Maintenance Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry

Welcome to the Copilot Hackathon! Today, you'll explore the power of enterprise AI automation by building a Predictive Maintenance Assistant using Microsoft Copilot Studio and Azure AI Foundry. Through this hands-on experience, you'll learn how to design a conversational AI solution that can monitor equipment health, predict failures, and automate maintenance workflows to reduce downtime and optimize industrial operations.

## Introduction

Your mission is to create an AI-powered Predictive Maintenance Assistant that transforms how organizations handle industrial equipment monitoring and maintenance scheduling. Leveraging Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure AI Foundry, Azure IoT Hub, and Azure AI Search, you'll design a system that can analyze sensor data, predict equipment failures, detect anomalies, and automate maintenance workflows—reducing downtime and improving operational efficiency.

This assistant will act as a virtual maintenance engineer integrating automation, reasoning, and observability to deliver faster equipment monitoring, smarter failure prediction, and consistent maintenance optimization across industrial operations.

## Learning Objectives

By participating in this hackathon, you will learn how to:

- Create a predictive maintenance chatbot using Microsoft Copilot Studio.
- Integrate Power Automate workflows for automated equipment monitoring and maintenance alert processing.
- Deploy and connect Azure AI Foundry and Azure IoT Hub for telemetry analysis and failure prediction.
- Build retrieval-augmented experiences using Azure AI Search for contextual equipment query responses.
- Implement observability and telemetry with Azure Monitor to track equipment health metrics and predictive analytics.

## Hackathon Format: Challenge-Based

This hackathon adopts a challenge-based learning format, providing a hands-on experience through three progressive stages that mirror a real-world predictive maintenance implementation. Each challenge focuses on a key capability of the Predictive Maintenance Assistant:

- **Challenge 1: Foundation** - Build a basic Copilot agent that can answer maintenance FAQs and guide equipment status checking using knowledge sources.
- **Challenge 2: Integration** - Integrate Power Automate and Azure IoT Hub to automate equipment monitoring, process telemetry data, and trigger maintenance alerts based on threshold violations.
- **Challenge 3: Intelligence** - Connect Azure AI Foundry and Azure AI Search to add failure prediction, equipment optimization recommendations, and predictive analytics with dashboards for maintenance metrics.

Throughout each challenge, you'll:

- Analyze the problem statement and business scenario.
- Strategize and design a scalable technical solution.
- Leverage your Azure environment to deploy, integrate, and test components.

## Challenge Overview

Your journey begins with setting up Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a conversational maintenance assistant capable of answering procedure queries and guiding equipment management. You'll then integrate Power Automate and Azure IoT Hub to automate equipment monitoring and alert processing. Finally, you'll enhance the assistant with Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Search, and Azure Monitor to deliver intelligent failure prediction, optimization recommendations, and executive dashboards for strategic maintenance decision-making.

By the end of this hackathon, you'll have a fully functional AI-driven Predictive Maintenance Assistant capable of autonomous equipment monitoring, intelligent failure prediction, and end-to-end maintenance workflow automation.
